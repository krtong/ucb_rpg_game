/*

There are three different locations (divs) for the game. 
1. Staging area:
    a. at the begining of the game the staging area is populated with all characters.
    b. a player is to choose which character they want to play as.
    c. once a player has chosen a character the chosen character is moved to the next staging area.

    challenges:
        - populate the area with characters.
        - when a character is selected, change the status of all characters to either enemy or player.
        - move each character around based on their status as either enemy or player.

How to move characters once selected:
    Store the HTML of each character on the character object. 





2. Staging area II: choose enemy.
    a. chosen character is in one div.
    b. enemy characters are in another div. 
    c. player is to choose which character they want their character to fight.

    challenges: 
        - when an enemy character is selected, change their status to selected and move them to a new area to fight.
        - make the selected character fightable.
